Yet Another Markup Language(YAML): Ansible uses Yaml language which is human readable and easily understandable. It has a slightly simple and different notation when compared to JSON or XML.
Rules of Yaml file:
- It starts with three dashes (---) and ends with three dots(...)
- We can use abbreviations to use represent dictionaries
James: {
  name: James Kirk,
  rollNo: 12345,
  gender: Male,
  division: B}
- List : Each item in the list is added in a new line with - followed by space in the same indentation.
